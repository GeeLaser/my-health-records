# My Health Records

  My Health Records is an application which enables everyday people to manage their own health records. Built on top of EHRbase (an implementation of the openEHR standard for Electronic Health Records), My Health Records allows users to upload, view and quickly share their health records with Medical professionals; all from a convenient web interface.
  
  The front end of the application is built using the standard trio of HTML, CSS and Javascript. The backend of the application is just EHRbase. Their project can be found here https://github.com/ehrbase/ehrbase Communication between the front end and the back end is handled via a REST api. The api is outlined as part of the openEHR standard. More information on that can be found here https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/ITS-REST/latest
